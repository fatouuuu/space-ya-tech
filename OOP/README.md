# Object-Oriented Programming

## what is OOP?

    It is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications and computer programs.

    In simpler terms, OOP is a way of organising and structuring code in a way that makes it easier to understand and maintain. It does this by breaking code down to small, reusable chunks called `objects`

    The code are related and can interact with each other
